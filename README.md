# Prodigy_Ml_Task_2

Data Handling and Preprocessing:

Downloading a dataset (Food-101) and extracting it. Reading and preprocessing data files (train.txt and test.txt) to create DataFrames containing image paths and labels. Shuffling and preparing the data using pandas DataFrames. Data Visualization:

Visualizing random images from the dataset to understand the data distribution and quality. Creating bar plots to visualize class imbalance in the dataset.

Training and Evaluation:

Implementing training and testing functions (train_step and test_step) to train the model using supervised learning with Cross-Entropy Loss, and evaluate its performance on unseen data. Training over multiple epochs, optimizing with the Adam optimizer (torch.optim.Adam), and monitoring metrics like loss and accuracy.

Evaluation and Visualization:

Evaluating model performance visually by predicting and comparing random subsets of test data, displaying prediction accuracy on images. Plotting training and validation metrics (accuracy and loss) across epochs to analyze model performance and convergence.
